    <p>
      A dosa is a thin crêpe in South Indian cuisine made from a fermented
      batter of ground black gram (lentil) and rice. Dosas have now become
      popular elsewhere in South Asia. Dosas are served hot, often with chutney
      and sambar.

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>1 cup whole wheat flour</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons vegetable oil</li>
      <li>1 pinch salt</li>
      <li>1 pinch baking soda</li>
      <li>1 ¾ cups water, or more as needed</li>
      <li>¼ cup vegetable oil</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Combine flour, 2 tablespoons oil, salt, and baking soda together in a
        bowl. Mix for 1 to 2 minutes. Add 1 3/4 cup water and mix until it's
        lump free, the chunks of flour have dissolved, and the batter has a good
        consistency, adding more water if needed.
      </li>
      <li>
        Heat 1 tablespoon oil on a griddle over medium heat. Pour some of the
        batter onto the griddle; spread the batter in a circular motion, slowly
        yet steadily. Cook until the edges start to brown, 2 to 3 minutes.
        Remove from the grill. Repeat with remaining batter, adding more oil
        between each batch.
